# Diagnosis and Treatment Documentation System

## Overview

The Diagnosis and Treatment Documentation System is a comprehensive solution for healthcare providers to document, track, and report on patient diagnoses and treatments. The system provides a structured approach to managing medical information using standardized diagnosis codes and detailed treatment records.

## Features

### Diagnosis Management

- **ICD Code Integration**: Use standardized ICD-10 codes for consistent diagnosis documentation
- **Severity Tracking**: Document diagnosis severity (low, medium, high)
- **Status Monitoring**: Track diagnosis status (active, resolved, chronic)
- **Provider Assignment**: Associate diagnoses with specific healthcare providers

### Treatment Details

- **Treatment-Diagnosis Linking**: Connect treatments directly to specific diagnoses
- **Treatment Workflow**: Track treatment status (planned, in-progress, completed, discontinued)
- **Effectiveness Evaluation**: Document treatment effectiveness (poor, fair, good, excellent)
- **Date Range Tracking**: Record treatment start and end dates

### Diagnosis Codes Management

- **Code Repository**: Centralized database of diagnosis codes
- **Categorization**: Organize codes by medical categories
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find relevant codes
- **Custom Codes**: Add organization-specific codes as needed

### Documentation & Records

- **Clinical Notes**: Document patient-specific observations and details
- **File Attachments**: Attach relevant medical documents to patient records
- **Voice-to-Text**: Record notes using speech recognition technology

### Reporting

- **Customizable Reports**: Generate reports based on multiple criteria
- **Filtering Options**: Filter by date range, diagnosis codes, providers, and status
- **Export Capabilities**: Export reports for external use
- **Print Functionality**: Print reports directly from the system

## Technical Implementation

The system is built using React with Material-UI components and utilizes Redux for state management. Key technical components include:

- **Redux Store**: Centralized state management for patient history data
- **TypeScript Types**: Strongly typed data structures for diagnosis and treatment information
- **Material-UI Components**: Modern, accessible user interface elements
- **Date Management**: Date handling using date-fns library
